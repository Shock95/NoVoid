# NoVoid
No-void plugin made for the Nukkit server-software.
## Description:
Normally, players would end up dying when they fall into the void. This plugin changes that by teleporting the player to the world's spawn, or to the position set by the admin.
## Commands:
- /nv (Set's the spawn to teleport upon entering the void.)
- /sethearts <hearts> (Set's the amount of hearts lost upon entering the void.)
